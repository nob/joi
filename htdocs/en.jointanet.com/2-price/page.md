Other companies may charge hundreds of thousands or yen or more to design and develop a website. And then will charge additional fees for redesigning and updating as your business needs change. Moreover, you may have to deal with new designers as they come and go from companies and face hard to understand additional charges.

At JOINTANET you can rest assured that there are no hidden additional charges over the monthly fee of 45,000 yen and you will be dealing with the same reliable people. Moreover there are NO costs for initial design and development. And all server costs are also included in this monthly fee.

"今、ウェブサイトはお客様のビジネスの一部を担うもの。変化しながら成長し続けるお客様のビジネスに合わせて、見た目も中身も変わり続けるウェブサイトこそが価値のあるものだろう。" と私達は考えます。
ならば、単に制作したウェブサイトをあなたに **納品する** だけではなく、**月額一律料金のサービス** としてご提供するのがあなたにとって最適だと考えます。<br/>
We at Jointanet believe that your web site plays an important role in your business. And as your business grows and changes, there is real value in updating the look and contents of your website as well. That is why we don't just create a website and simply **hand it over**, with our **monthly fee service** we promise to keep working with you to make your site the best it can be.
<br/>
**Contracts are renewed very month!** We have confidence in what we are doing and see no reason to tie up customers in long term contracts. <br/>

###Additional Service and Fees

- **Domain Registration and Maintenance Fees**<br>
The domain name (xxxx.com) you select for your business is important as is the place where you store your web site. Please feel free to register and maintain your own domain or contract with other sources.
Of course we can also take care of these matters for customers. In addition to our monthly charge we will charge a yearly domain registration and maintenance fee (**between 1,000 and 4,000 yen**)<br>
<br>

- **On-Site Support Costs** <br>
ジョインタネットが提供するサービスにおいて、**遠方のお客様の所への頻繁な出張** が発生致しますと別途、交通費が掛かってしまいます。ご了承下さい。<br>
お客様と実際にお会いしてのコミュニケーションが一番良いのですが、上記の月額料金の範囲であなたにご提供可能な、あなたとの打ち合わせ、各種サポートやアドバイス等は、Email、電話や音声/ビデオ通話を通じてのコミュニケーションを前提としたものとなっております。
[Google ハングアウト](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/?hl=ja)や[Skype](http://www.skype.com/ja/)等を使った私達とのコミュニケーションにできるだけご協力頂きます様、宜しく御願い申し上げます。<br>
<br>
If it becomes necessary for us to make frequent trips to customers who are far away we will charge for transportation fees.
We strongly believe that face-to-face meetings are the best way to communicate. But due to time and scheduling the above monthly service fee is based on having meetings and discussions via e-mail, telephone, and video conference. Although it may be difficult to actually meet and talk in person we will make every effort to use such online services as [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/?hl=ja) and [Skype](http://www.skype.com/ja/) to carry out effective communication. 

- **Additional Fees for Online Shops** <br>
Please note that for customers wishing to create and maintain and online shop that additional fees above the basic monthly fee are necessary. The amount of these fees will depend upon the contents, including the size of the shop and what kind of goods and /or services will be sold there.
